# HTML Assignment 3

This project is part of my web development learning journey. In this assignment, I practiced creating **multi-page navigation** using HTML and internal linking between different pages.

It demonstrates how to structure simple websites with multiple documents, embed images, and use semantic HTML for better page organization.

To build a multi-page HTML website with:
